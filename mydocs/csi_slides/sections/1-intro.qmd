##  Broader view of the Graph4Health ANR {.unnumbered}

::: {.incremental}
- The general objective is to 
  - infer the causal impact of the **healthcare supply** (and its geographic distribution) on **health outcomes**
    - using classic econometric tools
    - **using deep learning methods for causal inference**
  - study policies that contribute to the efficiency of the French healthcare system

- **11 years of exhaustive SNDS**
  - 70M patients
  - consultations, procedures, hospitalizations, medications, deaths etc.

## My project: embedding patient pathways for causal inference {.unnumbered}

- Our data: patient (medical) pathways
  - unstructured (just as in NLP)
  - temporally irregular (not like NLP!)
- To feed classical causal ML estimators, we need to represent those pathways as vectors (_embeddings_)
