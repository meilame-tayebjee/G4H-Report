## Causal inference {.unnumbered .scrollable}

- **Goal**: Estimate the impact of losing one's *Médecin Traitant* (Primary Care Provider, PCP), and looping back with Titouan's work

::: {.incremental}
- Up to a given time $t$, we have:

  - The covariate $X_{<t} \coloneqq (e_{<t}, t_{<t}, f_{<t})$, the medical history of the patient
  - $W_t$ is the (binary) treatment at time t, say: the patient has lost its PCP (death or retirement) before $t$
  - $Y_t (W_t)$, the binary outcome, indicating **whether death has occured within a given time window** $[t, t+ \delta_d]$

- We want to estimate the **Conditional Average Treatment Effect** (CATE):
$$ \tau(x, t) \coloneqq \mathbf{E}[Y_t(1) - Y_t(0) | X_{<t} = x]$$

## Improving pre-training task {.unnumbered}

- Exploring Posson loss - ground truth being **number of events** for each token, for each time window
- Exponential loss for time-to-event task (as in MOTOR (@steinberg2024motor))

We want ideally to have a generative model.

## Scaling {.unnumbered .scrollable}

- @chinchilla propose a **scaling law** for LLMs
  - Trade off between number of training tokens (train dataset size) and number of parameters in the model (model size)
  - Estimated optimal ratio: 
  $$\frac{\text{\# training tokens}}{\text{\# parameters}} = 20$$

    - is it the same for medical pathways ?
